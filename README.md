# Katie Wilson Portfolio

## Description

Within my portfolio, I have included my initial challenge from the Bootcamp. When looking through the site you will have links that take to you each section of my work and a picture of myself included in the About Me section. Under Work, when you click on the card that you are interested in, the corresponding card enlarges to show you the work for that section. The pictures are linked to a URL. The first picture is an active link to my deployed website but the following 3 have yet to be created. 
You will find variables for colours wihtin my CSS and multiple hover options when you are exploring the page. 
The page has set media-queries for iPhone and I have taken away the background image as well as stacked the sections to be more appealing on an iPhone. 
In the Contact Me section, you will find an active link to my GitHub account as well as a mailing option for my email once it is clicked.
